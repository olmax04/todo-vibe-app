## 🎯 About the Project

This project was created as a **coding playground** — an experimental space for:

- 🧪 Exploring **Cursor AI** capabilities in real development
- 🎵 Practicing the **vibe-coding** approach (when code is written in flow, intuitively)
- 🚀 Experimenting with modern technologies and patterns
- 📚 Learning React and web development best practices

**Not a production-ready project**, but rather a creative laboratory for experiments and learning.

---

## 🌍 Supported Languages

- 🇷🇺 Russian (default)
- 🇬🇧 English

Language preference is saved to localStorage and automatically applied on next visit.
